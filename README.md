# Overview

My map software is the tutorial software with some changes because it wouldn't work. I did this because I couldn't figure out how to get data for another place.  I've come to a conclusion that this is something I don't want to do for a career. For this project, I ultimately just wanted to practice learning how to learn a new project that was tough for me to learn. My project used data from the ArcGIS system, and it displayed trails, trail heads, open spaces and parks in a start park in California by Los Angeles.  

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.  These languages help us to make and customize websites in any way we can think of.  CSS gives the page color, width, and anything else that adds style.  HTML is the page that we use to create the website main page and any extra pages.  JavaScript is used to create more flexibility in the website.  I also used the libraries to get the map data from the ArcGIS website.

# Future Work

* Find a way to change map spawn place
* Add more popups besides trails, trailheads, etc
* Add the ability to filter popups# GIS-Mapping
